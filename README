Some random tools and scripts that I use in various development.
Decentral git backup :) Might or might not be useful to others.

Shell scripts
  * git-sync-upstream : sync a fork to the upstream repo.
  * git-new-feature   : create a new branch with date and short feature name
  * git-open-pr-files : find all the files that are currently open in PRs on GH

C++ scripts
  * run-clang-tidy-cached.cc : Run clang-tidy in parallel on project and cache
            results to speed up the pretty slow clang-tidy processing runtime.
	    A c++ program that can be invoked as a 'script' (self-compiles).
  * move-header-to-front.cc : if a particular include is found in a file,
            move it right in front of the first include of that file if
	    not already.
	    Can be used to move the declaration header for an implementation
	    to the front.
	    (Note: does not take #ifdefs into account, so might need manual
	    intervention to move if not desired at the location).
  * insert-header.cc : insert a header into file(s), if not already there.
            Puts <>-headers before the first <>-header, others before the first
	    "" header (if available). Other than that, does not make any
	    attempt to sort the final headers or understand if it ended up
	    in the right group (that is what clang-format is for :) ).


The *.cc files are done that they act as self-compiling 'scripts'. So
they can be invoked with e.g. ./insert-header.cc
